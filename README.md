In BYTE, the authentication feature is implemented using Firebase Authentication to handle both traditional sign-up/login processes and to integrate Google sign-in for streamlined user access. This setup allows users to register and authenticate using their email addresses or directly via their Google accounts, leveraging OAuth 2.0 protocols for secure and convenient user authentication.

- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user registration, login, and data security. Firebase's backend services provide robust, secure management of user authentication data, supporting a seamless integration with the app's frontend.
- **Google Sign-In**: Enhances ease of use by enabling users to log in with their existing Google accounts, reducing the barrier for new user registration and improving the overall user experience.

**Benefits**:
- **Security and Reliability**: Firebase Authentication provides a secure and reliable authentication infrastructure, which is crucial for maintaining user trust and data integrity.
- **Ease of Use**: By allowing users to sign in with Google, BYTE simplifies the login process, making it faster and more user-friendly, especially for users already logged into their Google accounts on their devices.
- **Scalability**: The use of Firebase ensures that the authentication system can scale effortlessly as the user base grows, without requiring additional setup for handling increased traffic or data.

This dual-method authentication approach not only enhances security but also caters to user convenience, making it an essential feature for the inclusive and user-focused design of BYTE.
